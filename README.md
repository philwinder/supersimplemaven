# supersimplemaven
A starter project that pulls in an Elastisearch dependency. 

## Installation
1. Clone / download this repository
2. run `mvn install` in the directory with the pom file
3. `cd target`
4. run `java -jar supersimplemaven-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

## TODO
This appears to create an Elasticsearch node, which I don't want it to.
Find code that will only connect to a current cluster.
